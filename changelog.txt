Alpha 0.9

The beginning
- Bot statically responds to a command (test)


Alpha 0.9.1

- Planned logic for learning

Alpha 0.9.2

- Switched to use the POS-JS dependancy for Parts of Speech identification
- Added POS storage system, however it only remembers the last word in a sentence
- Git push may contain some disorganized CSV files generated by the storage system

Alpha 0.9.3

- Replaced some var declarations with let, fixing a problem where it only remembers the last word in a sentence
- New problems:
    - Adding the number '2' in front of some remembered words, or straight up writing '2' to the file
    - Overwriting previous data with new data, instead of pushing new word to the array of old ones
- I don't know why I used this version naming scheme
